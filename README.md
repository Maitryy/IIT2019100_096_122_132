   We have considered the scenario of IIITA, in this project we've developed a web-based application for online classroom management. This incorporates development of several modules such as Program, Program objectives (PO), Classroom, Schedule, etc. A program is constructed, for instance, by specifying the broad area of study, the type (UG/PG), the program objectives (POs), NUMERIC of credits, and a list of courses categorized for example as core, technical electives and non technical electives. The courses are chosen from a catalogue of courses database. The POs characterize the attributes of a graduate of a program. The objectives are brief, clear statements that describe the desired learning outcomes of instruction; i.e., the specific skills, values, and attitudes students should exhibit at the end of the program or after a certain time period following the completion of the program. Classroom is an instance of a course, where the teacher runs a course. This is where teachers interact with students and students interact with: content, teachers, and peers. Students also get evaluated in classrooms and have the freedom to choose the learning modules in collaboration with the teacher.
